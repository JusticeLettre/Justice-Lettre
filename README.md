<h1>Hi, I'm Justice! <br/><a href="https://github.com/JusticeLettre">b͟e͟g͟i͟n͟n͟e͟r͟ ͟i͟n͟t͟o͟ ͟C͟y͟b͟e͟r͟S͟e͟c͟u͟r͟i͟t͟y͟</a>

 
<h2><b>I am an individual with a strong passion for the field of Cyber Security. I am highly dedicated, open-minded, and naturally curious about exploring and learning about the latest developments in the field.

My primary objective is to protect people's personally identifiable information (PII) and sensitive personal identifiable information (SPII) of the organization to the best of my abilities. I understand that the consequences of a cyber-attack can be devastating for individuals, businesses, and organizations. Therefore, I am highly committed to ensuring that all data is kept safe and secure.

With my adaptability and resilience, I remain calm and collected even when faced with various cyber-attacks. Collaboration is key to success in this field, and I strongly believe in working together to keep the organization's reputation and data safe from threat actors. I am always ready to face challenges and obstacles, and my adaptability and resilience enable me to overcome any difficulties that may arise.

I am aware that cyber-attacks come in different forms, and I am always eager to explore and experience new types of attacks. This approach can help me develop a comprehensive understanding of the various types of attacks and how they can be prevented or mitigated.

In the event of a cyber-attack, I will utilize my manual to help me through as much as I can, ask for help if needed, and seek second opinions to make the right decision during attacks. I understand the importance of making quick and informed decisions in this field, and I am always ready to take the necessary steps to protect the organization's data.

Cybersecurity interests me because of the dedication and drive required to protect businesses and individuals from harmful attacks. I am always eager to learn new ways to stay safe and prepared for potential threats every day. Protecting businesses and individuals' information is a top priority for me, and I am committed to ensuring that all data is kept safe and secure at all times.</b></h2>

<h2>As of 08/06/2025, I am trying to finish my "Tools of the Trade: Linux and SQL." I'm at the very end, but I have learned how to use queries to find specific parts of the job and filter what I need to get, as well as find people and machines from different countries. </h2>
